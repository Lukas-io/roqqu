# 🜂 Roqqu Coding Assessment

> *"Code flows. Bytes breathe. The app awakens."*

A mystical take on a crypto mobile experience — where design meets rhythm and code becomes expression.  
Built with Flutter, animated by intent, and guided by simplicity.

## ✨ Design Note

I noticed Roqqu uses **Inter** as its primary font,  
but I personally preferred **FormaDJR** for this build.  
It added a bit more character and warmth —  
I hope that’s not a deal breaker :)
