## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers for business logic, data models, services, and UI
- **GetX State Management**: Lightweight reactive state management solution
- **Repository Pattern**: Centralized data access through service layer
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive UI for different screen sizes

### Folder Structure

### Notable Features
1. **Real-time WebSocket Integration**: Continuous data streaming from Binance
2. **Intelligent Reconnection Logic**: Exponential backoff strategy for network resilience
3. **Advanced Charting**: Custom painters for price visualization
4. **Biometric Security**: Local authentication for secure access
5. **Smooth Animations**: Physics-based animations using Sprung library

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **WebSocket Connection Management**: Implemented exponential backoff reconnection strategy
2. **Data Synchronization**: Used reactive programming with GetX for seamless UI updates
3. **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of streams and controllers to prevent leaks
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Unified approach for iOS and Android biometric authentication

### Known Limitations
- Currently supports only 4 major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA, DOGE)
- No offline mode for market data
- Limited trading pair options (USDT pairs only)
